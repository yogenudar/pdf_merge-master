I hated using online tools for merging my PDF files so I wrote a Python 3.6 script to merge all PDF files in a folder to a new PDF file.

# Usage
Put the script (or the executable, if you prefer to download binaries from the releases) and the pdf files you want to merge in the same folder.  
Run the script (or the executable).  
The merged pdf will be created as OUTPUT.pdf  
Merge order is alphabetic.  

# Installation
```
pip install pikepdf
git clone https://github.com/gonultasbu/pdf_merge 
```
# TODO

- PDF Reordering
- Compression
- Web App
